# SimpleD
Text based data-interchange format.
Project started in 2009 as a replacement to XML, for use in games and other applications where performance and size is important.

SimpleD was originally written in VB.Net, then ported to C#, PHP and Java.
While developing I wrote a custom tester that tested syntax of the implementation, and performance as I optimized.
C#'s single-file can easily be dropped in a project and is Unity3D compatible, but does not contain serialization witch most Unity Dev's are use to.
The PHP port was used in a few websites, and has not been thoroughly tested, with other options such as JSON this should not be used.
The Java port was never really used or tested, it was built as a programming exercise.
